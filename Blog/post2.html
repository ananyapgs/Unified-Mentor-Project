      <p>Augmented reality and virtual reality are two sides of the metaverse.
         Augmented reality could increase advertising space in the real world with new special glasses.
          Virtual reality would in itself create a whole new digital area for advertising. 
          The technology still has some catching up to do until it could be considered one of the rapidly emerging technologies
          </p>
          <p>The big driver of the Metaverse experience is gaming trends. As the Metaverse's technical capabilities grow, more games will 
          be available there that completely immerse you in the experience. 
          And that life-changing experience is what will make people move to the Metaverse. This also begs the question: what is reality?
           And, will virtual reality take over the real world? Real estate in metaverse is a trend within the reality environment. 
           Put on your glasses to see your virtual real estate mansions. Booming real estate businesses within the virtual environment are fresh and new.
        </p>
        <p>So, why is the Metaverse part of the tech trends? It could be summarized with 
           this one point: we could eventually get to the point where people live most of their 
           lives in the Metaverse. The expansion of the Metaverse is one of the bigger technology trends.
